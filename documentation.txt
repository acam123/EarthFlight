*/THIS IS AN OLD DOCUMENTATION FOR SCHOOL

To set up: this game you must move this folder to your localhost 
    (e.g. mv -r Final_Project2 ~/localhost). Once there you must
    make sure the permissions are correct. To do so cd into the 
    Final_Project2 directory and run the following commands 
    (a la pset8's implementation):
        find . -type f | xargs chmod 644
        find . -type d | xargs chmod 711
    These making everything respectively readable and executable 
    by everyone. Lastly run "chmod 711" on your localhost directory
    and any directories that localhost is located in up to and 
    including the home directory "~" (e.g. chmod 711 ~/.../localhost; 
    ... chmod 711 ~ ). 

NOTE: This process may be different on different machines, but the
    concept of altering the diecotry permissions and should still apply
    though where you place Final_Project2 may be different from localhost.

To get dependencies: You can download google earth from: 
    "http://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/plugin.html", or 
    go to view the game now simply open a browser and go to the url 
    "http://your.ip.address/Final_Project2". You will see a screen that 
    asks you to dowload google earth if you have not already done so, 
    please click on the link and continue to download the plug-in, 
    returning to the above mentioned page when done. 

To play: once in the game you can play by using the controls listed below. 
    Fly around and try to find all of the hoops. If you click the screen 
    and the controls stop working, try clicking the start button. If that 
    doesn't work, refresh the page. 

Game Controls:
    w: move forward
    s: move back
    d: slide right
    a: slide left
    c: change camera view/plane mode
    up arrow: tilt up
    down arrow: tilt down
    left arrow: turn left
    right arrow: turn right
    space bar: increase altitude
    shift: decrease altitude
    
NOTE: This game was made in the cs50 appliace using vmware on a macbook. 
    The game was tested/played in firefox outside of the appliance
    (with the appliance running to serve the website). Graphics work
    best in full screen.
